\begin{abstract}

Sports betting is a wide-spread activity among sports fans and successful betting motivates the exploration of ways to accurately predict the outcome of soccer matches and other sporting events. In this project, we explore the use of machine learning tools and techniques to predict the outcome of soccer matches from around the world. Using various algorithms and feature sets, we were unable to obtain predictors which were able to accurately predict outcomes better than simply predicting a result for the home team. While this shows the importance of home-field advantage in soccer, it also indicates that using relevant data and appropriate hypothesis spaces impacts the performance of machine learning models. For future work, it is desirable to further explore ways to accurately represent intangible elements of sports such as injury, winning- and losing-streaks, and performance against rivals.
